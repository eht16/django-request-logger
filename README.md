Overview
========

A simple app to configure a common logging setup for Django projects.
This app re-configures Django's logging setup, build (or read from
passed HTTP headers) a unique request-id and add a filter to enrich
log records with information from the request (status code,
path, user, ...) and add the previously created request-id to
the log record.

This is most probably not useful to anyone else, it's quite tailored
to my personal needs and is not very configurable (on purpose).


The RequestIDMiddleware class is based on https://github.com/dabapps/django-log-request-id.


DISCLAIMER
==========

This is not a general purpose app. This is tailored for my own personal use
and should not be used unmodified by others.
However, you may use it to learn or to adjust it to  your needs.
Still, these are not the best practices ever and the code might be buggy.


Installation
============
1. Install:

    pip install git+git://github.com/eht16/django-request-logger#egg=django-request-logger

2. Add middleware "" to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES (ideally near the top):

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        "...",
        "django_request_logger.middleware.RequestIDMiddleware",
        "...",
    )

3. Configure log file path in settings.py:

    DJANGO_REQUEST_LOGFILE = '/var/log/django/myproject.log'

4. Other settings in settings.py:

    # add the request-id to the response HTTP headers, e.g. for logging with Lighttpd
    # set this to resulting header name which should be added, set to None or unset to disable
    DJANGO_REQUEST_SET_REQUEST_ID_HEADER = 'X-LIGHTTPD-REQUESTID'
    # read an already existing request-id from the request HTTP headers, e.g. set by a webserver
    # set this to given header name which should be added, set to None or unset to disable
    DJANGO_REQUEST_LOG_REQUEST_ID_HEADER = 'HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID'
